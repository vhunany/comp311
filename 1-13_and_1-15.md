#### My solutions

1. **OR**: For hybrid cars, you can either use gas or electricity. If you are out of gas, you switch to electricity and you are still able to drive. If you are out of battery, you switcht to gas and you are still able to drive. If you do not have gas or battery, you can not drive. 

    In this case, the inputs would be the gas and battery. If gas is 0 (no gas) and battery is 1 (has electricity), the output is 1. And vice versa. If both are 0, then you can not drive, so output is 0. 

    **AND**: To use my mouse, I need to the USB-C connected to my computer AND the mouse has to be on. If the mouse is not on (0), I can't use the mouse (output = 0). If the USB-C is not connected, then I can use my mouse and vice versa. We can take this a step above by including the computer having battery or not.

2. For n inputs, each with the possiblilty of being a 1 or 0 (2 options), we have $2^n$ rows. So for a 4-input logic gate we have $2^4 = 16$.
