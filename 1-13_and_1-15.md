#### Practice Problems 
1. Identify a real-world example for an AND gate and one for an OR gate other than those presented in this chapter.
2. How many rows does the truth table for a 4-input logic gate have?
3. Construct the truth table for a four-input OR gate.
4. Construct the truth table for a two-input NAND gate.
5. Construct the truth table for a three-input Exclusive-NOR gate.
6. Construct the truth table for a three-input OR gate using "don't cares" for the inputs similar to the truth table constructed for the three-input AND gate shown in Figure 4-13.
7. Draw the output X for the pattern of inputs shown in the figure below for a three input NAND gate.
8. Repeat problem 7 for a NOR gate.
9. Show the output waveform of an AND gate with the inputs A, B, and C indicated in the figure below.
10. Develop the truth table for each of the combinational logic circuits shown below.
